                used for sigmoid or softmax. Defaults to True.
            gamma (float, optional): The gamma for calculating the modulating
                factor. Defaults to 2.0.
            alpha (float | list[float], optional): A balanced form for Focal
                Loss. Defaults to 0.5. When a list is provided, the length
                of the list should be equal to the number of classes.
                Please be careful that this parameter is not the
                class-wise weight but the weight of a binary classification
                problem. This binary classification problem regards the
                pixels which belong to one class as the foreground
                and the other pixels as the background, each element in
                the list is the weight of the corresponding foreground class.
                The value of alpha or each element of alpha should be a float
                in the interval [0, 1]. If you want to specify the class-wise
                weight, please use `class_weight` parameter.
            reduction (str, optional): The method used to reduce the loss into
                a scalar. Defaults to 'mean'. Options are "none", "mean" and

            class_weight (list[float], optional): Weight of each class.

            loss_weight (float, optional): Weight of loss. Defaults to 1.0.
            loss_name (str, optional): Name of the loss item. If you want this
                loss item to be included into the backward graph, `loss_` must
